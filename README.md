# libxdiff (Debian 7/8)
The LibXDiff library implements basic and yet complete functionalities to create file differences/patches to both binary and text files.

This repository is a fork of libxdiff-0.23 that can be built on Debian Wheezy and Jessie. No modification will be made to the actual code, except necessary fixes for compilation.
